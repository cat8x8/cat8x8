I mostly make apps for windows, linux and websites. Rust lang can do it all ! Thr code structure here is superior to others who have 20 annoying  files. In this code, you will find main.rs as the full app code. (And Cargo.toml of course). As such, my apps are incredibly easy to feed to Ai in order to audit for safety or change anything you want- BAM ! Lastly, manual coding is lame...i watch chess streamers or play chess while Ai codes the apps- weeeeeeeeeeeeeee !
