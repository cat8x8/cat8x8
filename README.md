I mostly make apps for windows, linux and websites. Rust lang can do it all ! My code structure is superior to others who have 20 annoying  files. In my code, you will find main.rs as the full app code. (And Cargo.toml of course). As such, my apps are incredibly easy to feed to Ai in order to audit for safety or change anything you want- BAM ! Lastly, i think manual coding is lame...i watch tv or play chess while Ai codes the apps better than i ever could :)
